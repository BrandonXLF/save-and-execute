# se â€“ Save and Execute

`se` is a command-line utility written in Rust that allows you to save commands and then conveniently execute then at any time.

To use it you can either execute `se <action>` for each action you want to perform or run `se` to enter a simple custom command-line interface.

## Integrations

The Windows installer offers integration into the Windows Terminal and the system path.

## Developing

`se` is built using Cargo and Rust. Once those are installed run `cargo install` to install dependencies and `cargo run` to run the app. See Cargo for more options.

The Windows installer is built from `install.iss` with Inno Setup.
